	"introductionkey": "There has been quite some debate about the scope for mitigating climate change by soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration. However, it seems there is a general lack of understanding of quantities and the time-dimension, as well as the possible contribution, that SOC-seq. can play. This web application provides a platform where users can visualize the organic carbon content of a soil of, their choice, as well as the quantitative impact of soil conserving management practices on sequestration, how such sequestration, would unfold over time and what would be the magnitude of SOC seq. if the anticipated practice (to foster SOC seq.) would be scaled, out to countries, sub-continents or the entire world. The basis of the idea is the publication from Sommer and Bossio 2014, (Dynamics and climate change mitigation potential of soil organic carbon sequestration. J. Environm. Management 144, 83-87.)",

However, you can change the adoption pattern of the sequestration scheme, by designing an “Area-uptake” curve, which defines how much area is successively brought under the assumed SOC sequestration scheme. Therefore, change the rate constant value by sliding the green slide bar",
